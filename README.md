# ADF Transaction Pipeline – Medallion Architecture

## Overview
This project implements a scalable, production-style data engineering pipeline using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** to ingest, validate, transform, and store synthetic financial transaction data. The pipeline follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold) to ensure data quality, traceability, and analytics readiness.

Transaction data is generated via a custom Python script and includes rich attributes such as transaction details, customer demographics, merchant category, geolocation, and product information.

## Architecture Summary

### Bronze Layer
- Raw JSON files generated by Python.
- Stored in Azure Blob Storage.
- No schema enforcement; serves as an immutable source of truth.

###  Silver Layer
- Data validation (file existence checks).
- Transformations via ADF Data Flows:
  - Column derivations (e.g. age, currency conversions).
  - Null value handling.
  - Deduplication and upserts.
  - Domain-specific splits: Transactions, Products, Customers, Transaction Details.
- Stored in Delta format (Parquet) and intermediate SQL tables.

### Gold Layer
- Aggregated and curated datasets:
  - Daily sales reports.
  - Fully joined tables across domains.
- Stored in Azure SQL Tables for BI and reporting.
