# üèõ Medallion Architecture ‚Äì ADF Transaction Pipeline

## 1. Introduction
The **Medallion Architecture** organizes data into three layers ‚Äî **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** ‚Äî to improve data quality, enable progressive refinement, and create analytics‚Äëready datasets.  
This approach ensures traceability from raw ingestion to curated outputs and aligns with modern data lakehouse best practices.

In this project, Azure Data Factory (ADF) orchestrates the end‚Äëto‚Äëend flow from raw financial transaction data generated by a Python script to curated datasets stored in Azure SQL Database and Azure Blob Storage in Delta format.

## 2. Bronze Layer ‚Äì Raw Data
**Purpose:** Store raw, unvalidated data exactly as received.

- Source: A Python script outputs JSON files with 20+ attributes per transaction (transaction details, customer info, merchant data, geolocation, product details).
- Storage: Landing zone in Azure Blob Storage.
- Characteristics:
  - No schema enforcement.
  - Preserves original format for replay/reprocessing.
  - Serves as the immutable ‚Äúsource of truth‚Äù for ingestion.

## 3. Silver Layer ‚Äì Cleaned & Enriched Data
**Purpose:** Hold validated, cleansed, and enriched datasets.

- Validation: Checks to ensure files exist and are readable before processing.
- Transformations in ADF Data Flow:
  - Column transformations and derived fields (e.g., age calculation from DOB, computed sale totals).
  - Null value detection and handling.
  - Deduplication and upserts based on primary keys (`TransactionID`, `ProductID`, `CustomerID`).
  - Domain‚Äëdriven splits into:
    - Transaction Details
    - Product Table
    - Customer Table
  - Aggregations for intermediate reporting (daily sales).
- Storage:
  - Delta (Parquet) format in Azure Blob Storage for analytical workloads.
  - Intermediate SQL tables for operational querying.

## 4. Gold Layer ‚Äì Curated & Aggregated Data
**Purpose:** Provide business‚Äëready datasets optimized for BI, analytics, and reporting.

- Aggregated sales and customer insights.
- Fully joined datasets across domains.
- Stored in Azure SQL Tables for direct consumption by BI tools (e.g., Power BI).
- Designed for high‚Äëspeed query performance and dashboard refresh efficiency.

---

## 5. Benefits of This Architecture
- **Data Quality Assurance:** Validation and enrichment in the Silver layer ensure reliable data.
- **Traceability:** Each layer maintains lineage back to Bronze.
- **Flexibility:** Delta format supports schema evolution and time‚Äëtravel queries.
- **Scalability:** Easily extendable to more sources or larger volumes.
